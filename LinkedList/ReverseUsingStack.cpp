/* 
 * Reverse using a Stack
 *
 * Traverse LinkedList to store the node values into a stack
 * Then poppint out values and then storing them again
 * At end, this will give reverse linkedlist values but the chains/links won't be reversed
 * Basically, we exchanged the numbers to get a reverse LinkedList
 * Complexity is 2N because the we traverse the LinkedList 2 times
 * Space Complexity is N as storing all the nodes into the stack
